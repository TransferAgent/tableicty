CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING:
SINGLE LOGIN ENDPOINT FOR ALL ROLES:
Everyone uses: /api/v1/shareholder/auth/login/
Role determines access AFTER login (not different endpoints)
THE 4 ROLES (TenantMembership.role):
Role	Permission Level	What They See
PLATFORM_ADMIN	Tableicty staff	ALL tenants (super admin)
TENANT_ADMIN	Company administrator	Admin Console + their holdings
TENANT_STAFF	Company staff	Limited admin features + their holdings
SHAREHOLDER	Investor/end user	ONLY their own holdings (read-only)
KEY INSIGHTS I WAS MISSING:
Role ≠ Shareholder ownership

SHAREHOLDER role = limited permissions
Actual share ownership = separate (Shareholder model)
TENANT_ADMIN can ALSO own shares
testadmin@tableicty.com is:

Django User ✅
TenantMembership with role=TENANT_ADMIN ✅
Potentially ALSO has holdings (shares) ✅
Can access Admin Console (gear icon) ✅
Admin Console visibility:

Shows for: TENANT_ADMIN and TENANT_STAFF roles
Hidden for: SHAREHOLDER role (even if they own shares)
Django Superuser ≠ PLATFORM_ADMIN:

Django superuser: /admin/ panel access (platform management)
PLATFORM_ADMIN: Application role (access all tenants via frontend)
ARCHITECTURE:
User (Django auth)
  └── TenantMembership (role + tenant assignment)
        ├── role: PLATFORM_ADMIN | TENANT_ADMIN | TENANT_STAFF | SHAREHOLDER
        └── tenant: Which company they belong to
              └── Shareholder model: Actual stock holdings (optional)
WHY THIS MATTERS FOR STAGING:
✅ testadmin@tableicty.com in staging:

Has TENANT_ADMIN role
Can access Admin Console
Login works via /api/v1/shareholder/auth/login/
Role-based permissions apply after authentication
✅ Django admin superuser (separate concern):

Only needed for platform debugging
Not for normal operations
Can be created later if needed
MY PREVIOUS CONFUSION - NOW CLEARED:
❌ I thought: Different user types = different endpoints
✅ Reality: Same endpoint, role determines UI/permissions

❌ I thought: "Shareholder" endpoint means actual shareholders
✅ Reality: Historical naming, serves all user roles

❌ I thought: Admin users don't own shares
✅ Reality: TENANT_ADMIN can be both admin AND shareholder
