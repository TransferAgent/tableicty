INVESTMENT TYPE DROPDOWN MISSING - DEBUGGING COMPLETE

ISSUE SUMMARY:
The Investment Type dropdown is not appearing in the "Issue Shares" modal.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
✅ Database field exists: core_shareissuancerequest.investment_type (character varying)
✅ Frontend code expects the field (based on your statement "code is correct")
❌ Backend API is NOT providing investment_type options to the frontend

API ENDPOINTS CHECKED:
1. GET /api/v1/tenant/issuers/ - Returns issuer data, NO investment_types
2. GET /api/v1/tenant/security-classes/ - Returns security classes, NO investment_types
3. GET /api/v1/shareholders/ - Returns shareholders, NO investment_types
4. GET /api/v1/holdings/ - Returns holdings, NO investment_types

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
One of these endpoints (or a new endpoint) should return:
{
  "investment_types": [
    {"value": "FOUNDER", "label": "Founder Shares"},
    {"value": "SEED", "label": "Seed Round"},
    {"value": "RETAIL", "label": "Retail Investment"},
    {"value": "FRIENDS_FAMILY", "label": "Friends & Family"}
  ]
}

FRONTEND BEHAVIOR:
The Issue Shares modal loads and makes these API calls:
- /api/v1/tenant/shareholders/
- /api/v1/tenant/security-classes/
- /api/v1/tenant/issuers/
- /api/v1/tenant/holdings/

But none of these responses contain investment_type dropdown options.

QUESTIONS:
1. Which API endpoint should return investment_type options?
2. Is there a missing endpoint like /api/v1/investment-types/?
3. Should investment_types be embedded in /api/v1/tenant/issuers/ response?
4. Or should they be in a form metadata endpoint like /api/v1/share-issuance/form-options/?

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Login to https://tableicty.com
2. Navigate to Shareholders page
3. Click "Issue Shares" button
4. Modal opens with fields for:
   - Issuer (dropdown) ✅
   - Security Class (dropdown - grayed until issuer selected) ✅
   - Number of Shares ✅
   - Cost Basis ✅
   - Acquisition Date ✅
   - Acquisition Type (dropdown - shows "ISSUANCE") ✅
   - Holding Type (dropdown - shows "DRS") ✅
5. MISSING: Investment Type dropdown should appear after Security Class

BROWSER CONSOLE:
No JavaScript errors in console.

NETWORK TAB:
All API calls return 200 OK. No failed requests.

DATABASE:
core_shareissuancerequest table has investment_type column (character varying, NOT NULL)

NEXT STEPS:
Please add investment_type options to the appropriate API endpoint response.
After deployment, I will test again.
