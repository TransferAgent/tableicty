📊 TABLE VIEW: WEEK-BY-WEEK BREAKDOWN
Week	Phase	Focus	Key Deliverables	Risk Level
1	Phase 1	Data Model	tenants table, tenant_id migrations	🟡 MEDIUM (data migration)
2	Phase 1	Auth	2FA, JWT updates, TenantMiddleware	🟢 LOW
3	Phase 1	Isolation	API updates, RBAC, tests	🟡 MEDIUM (tenant leakage risk)
4	Phase 1	Onboarding	Registration API, admin UI	🟢 LOW
5	Phase 2	Secrets	Vault setup, key migration	🟠 HIGH (key compromise risk)
6	Phase 2	API Security	Rate limiting, headers	🟢 LOW
7	Phase 2	Compliance	Audit logs, reports	🟢 LOW
8	Phase 2	Infrastructure	Backups, monitoring	🟢 LOW
9-10	Phase 3	Task A1	DTCC research doc	🟢 LOW
11-16	Phase 3	Task B	Go middleware, sandbox testing	🟡 MEDIUM (DTCC complexity)
17-20	Phase 3	Task C	Production DTCC deployment	🟠 HIGH (live transactions)
21-23	Phase 4	Admin Console	Issuer dashboard, cap table	🟢 LOW
24	Phase 4	Billing	Stripe, subscriptions	🟢 LOW
🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION
PROCEED WITH PHASE 1-2 IMMEDIATELY (8 weeks, 2 engineers)

Rationale:

Multi-tenancy is CRITICAL - Cannot scale without it
2FA is MANDATORY - Financial services compliance requirement
Security hardening is URGENT - Production readiness depends on it
DTCC can be parallel - Phase 3 can overlap with Phase 2 completion
ROI:

Phase 1-2 investment: 16 person-weeks (~$50K-$80K labor cost)
Enables: SaaS business model (10x revenue potential)
Unlocks: Customer acquisition (first 5 customers = $50K+ MRR)
Prepares: DTCC integration (gateway-ready architecture)
DO NOT DELAY: Every week without multi-tenancy is lost revenue opportunity.
