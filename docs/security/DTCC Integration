📊 DOCUMENT STATUS TRACKER
Research Progress by Section:
Section 1 (DTCC Overview): 🟢 70% Complete (public docs available)
Section 2 (Technical Specs): 🟡 30% Complete (awaiting DTCC portal access)
Section 3 (Security): 🟢 60% Complete (industry standards + AWS best practices)
Section 4 (Compliance): 🟢 80% Complete (SEC regulations publicly available)
Section 5 (Timeline): 🟡 50% Complete (awaiting DTCC onboarding details)
Blockers & Dependencies:
CRITICAL: DTCC TA Services Portal Access

Needed for: Complete message format specifications, sample messages
Impact: Section 2.2 (10 pages) cannot be finalized without this
Mitigation: Using public DTCC documentation and industry contacts meanwhile
HIGH: Industry Contact Introduction

Needed for: Real-world operational insights, message format examples
Impact: Validates theoretical research with practical experience
Mitigation: Relying on public sources and DTCC documentation
MEDIUM: FAST Agent Application Forms

Needed for: Appendix with actual forms
Impact: Minor (forms are reference material)
Mitigation: Can document process without forms, add later
Next Research Tasks:
 Deep-dive: DTCC API Marketplace (determine if APIs available for TA Services)
 SEC EDGAR: Review Form TA-2 filings from 3-5 comparable transfer agents
 DTCC Learning Center: Review all available FAST/DRS training materials
 Industry forums: Search for transfer agent technical communities
 AWS architecture: Research best practices for financial services compliance
